cell society
====

This project implements a cellular automata simulator.
Created for Duke CS 308 class.

Names: Jonathan Nakagawa, Ryan Piersma, Max Bartlett


### Primary Roles
Jonathan - Simulation

Ryan - Configuration

Max - Visualization

### Resources Used

Javadocs, Stack Overflow

### Running the Program

Main class: Main

Data files needed:

* labels.txt
* Any one of the files in ./xml

Interesting data files:

Features implemented:

* Game of Life
* Wator World
* FireSim
* Segregation
* SugarGame
* ColorGame (partially implemented)
* FileChooser within GUI & error handling
* Slider to dynamically control speed
* Graph representing sim information (partially implmented)

Assumptions or Simplifications:

Known Bugs:

* Graph not updating properly
* 
*

Assumptions or Simplifications:
None

Known Bugs:

* GridPane layout does not work with hexagons
* No error checking for intialization of grid with
probabilities for each cell type

Extra credit: Surviving

### Notes

XML Error checking checks for:
* invalid simulation types
* if the grid size is not in the XML file
* if the grid size doesn't match the grid specified
* if there is no method of grid initialization specified
* if the XML parser throws an error
* if the XML parser doesn't find values for specified XML tags
* default values for configuration parameters

### Impressions

Good project overall, the way it is designed means that we each have an even share of the work in simulation, configuration, and visualization.
